	<div id="content">
		<p> 	Working at Circle K has mostly been a learning experience in the art of the upsell and the value of customer retention. Early on it became
		clear that if I knew the deals in the store and found money saving opportunities for the customer, they would be very appreciative that I found
		these "loopholes" for them. They really weren't loopholes, but it has dawned on me that being knowledgable on every aspect of
		your store, your product, or your program is the single most important factor in providing great customer service. </p>

	<div id="content">
		<p> 	At Samâ€™s Club, focus is placed on keeping all the shelves stocked and 
		keeping the hot case of rotisserie chickens full. The latter requires adherence 
		to all Arizona health codes. Stocking is a matter of identifying your needs and 
		filling and rearranging spaces accordingly, often using a scanner to print new price tags. 
		Keeping a solid schedule is key to managing all of your tasks at once. 
		Optimizing the two hour cycle of chickens being taken out and put into the ovens was fun.

			<p> I got my first shot at management here. Responsibilities in addition to a standard crew member role include 
		managing cash register drops, filling out inventory paperwork each night, and assigning 
		crew members to the positions that suit them best. Knowledge of coworker strengths and tendencies is 
		key to a successful night. Being the one to settle greivences between coworkers or having to
			tell someone they made a customer uncomfortable were eye opening experiences that have stuck with me.
